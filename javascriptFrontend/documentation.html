      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Writo is an web-page based text editor. It is supposed to be run in FireFox. I have made no provisions for other browsers and used several features of which I know that IE doesn't support them. If you want to know how
        and why writo works, you'd best read <a href="#js/writo.js">Writo's 
        frontend documentations</a>. If you want to know how to interact with 
        writo you might want to read 
        <a href="#js/writo-tests.js">The tests</a>.
      </p>
      <p><i>My goals for this applications are as much learning about JavaScript and django as they are about actually producing a working application. Since explaining a concept in writing forces you to actually understand something the code might contain a lot of references and explanations that Javascript guru's find superflous. Please understand that I'm not insulting your knowledge but rather am trying to enhance my own. Comments on Javascript itself are written in italics like this.</i></p>
