                    to know how the software works or if you want to make your

                    <a href='http://github.com/jauco/Writo/'>c  heck out the source code</a>!
                    </p> 
                    <p>To get you started on what writo is I have provided a small introduction:
                    <ol>
                        <li>press the 'i' key on your keyboard.</li>
                        <li>The box with the cursor should become orange/pink. This means the application is in 'insert' mode.</li>
                        <li>type something</li>
                        <li>You'll see that the text appears</li>
                        <li>press the &lt;esc&gt; key to leave insert mode</li>
                        <li>You can remove characters with the backspace key</li>
                        <li>You can press 'u' and 'r' while not in insert mode to (u)ndo and (r)edo the last commands</li>
                        <li>pressing 'b' while not in insert mode will turn a paragraph into a heading</li>
                        <li>Try pressing a number before a command, for example: 5&lt;backspace&gt;</li>
                        <li>this also works for insert: 5iYeey! &lt;esc&gt;</li>
                        <li>If you leave this page and come back later it will still be exactly the same. You can still undo and redo. Even if you turned of your computer in the meantime!</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
