# Writo
Writo is an web-page based text editor.

## What writo should be:
A word processor that supports you in writing large documents that are both a 
product and a process, such as a thesis or a functional spec. The software
should allow you to write and rewrite and faithfully store your data. Allowing
you to backtrack and to re-read that paragraph you wrote two months ago, but 
scrapped sometime since. It should also relieve you of the need to format the 
document. You should be able to describe what you want to say. Presentation 
comes after.

## What writo currently is
A javascript object that handles keypresses and creates a DOM structure. I.E. if
you type characters they will appear on the screen. Also a full undo stack is 
saved. So turning the pc off and on will leave you exactly where you were. Even
if you have a power outage.

Advanced commands can be constructed. For example: pressing numeric keys before
executing a command will execute the command that many times (9<backspace> will
delete 9 characters)

# A remark about the implementation

Writo is supposed to be run in FireFox 3.5. I have made no provisions for other 
browsers and used several features of which I know that IE doesn't support them.
